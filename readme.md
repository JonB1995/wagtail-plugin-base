# Wagtail plugin base

A basic example for using webpack to bundle plugin assets.

## Getting started

`npm run build` will bundle the asets from the src directory into the dist directory.

## Usage

Currently, this is just for demo purposes. The intent is to create a plugin skeleton base to derive from in future.
